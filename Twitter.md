# Using Twitter in the classroom 

## Introduction
The purpose of this tutorial is to illustrate how to find tweets from a given location for use in the classroom. Twitter allows users to search for tweets in 34 languages across the world. This is invaluable for teaching and learning languages as it provides an opportunity for students to engage with authentic language and compare language usage in different areas. 
Possible assignments include:
1. Translating tweets
2. Researching the lingusitic and cultural context of a tweet
3. Comparing language use in different areas.
  1. Degree of formality
  2. Topics
  3. Use of non-textual features
4. Reflect on the role of this language in this area (is it a minority or majority language, high or low prestige?)
5. Who are these tweets written for?
  1. People physically close?
  2. Socially close?
6. And many more

## Basic Approach
*Best for exploring what is available. You will not be able to save the results of your search, but will get a sense of what data is available. You do NOT need a Twitter account for this approach.*

1. Navigate to [Twitter Advanced Search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced).
2. Under 'Words' is an option to search by language. Find your language.
3. Under 'Places' is an option to search 'Near this place.' By default, Twitter will search within 15 miles of that place regardless if it is an address, city, or country. You cannot change this. You can make your area of searching larger or smaller by selecting a larger or smaller geographic unit. 
Twitter will show you all of the tweets in Tweet form, ordered using their algorithm (promoted tweets first followed by all tweets in reverse chronological order). To reorder this list chronologically, select 'Live' at the top of the page. You cannot save this output.
4. You can save this search and return to it later. To do this, select 

## Intermediate Approach
*Best for saving a list of tweets using Twitter's default settings in the advanced search. This method will require the use of thrid-party plugins that may not be maintained. So, while this approach works as of late 2016, it may not always work.*

For this method, you will need a Twitter account, a Google Account, and either Firefox, Google Chrome, or Safari (do not use Internet Explorer).
